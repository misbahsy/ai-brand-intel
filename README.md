# AI Brand Intel
Brand Intelligence using AI. Our platform aggregates brand mentions on social media, news websites, and forums, and allows for an option to generate an AI-based response in over a 100-languages.

Brands can also generate responses using their own documentation, policies, rules and regulation. With a few clicks, brand representatives and respond back to the users. 

We use Qrant self-hosted solution for vector storage and Cohere Embeddings API to generate embeddings. Additionally, a Flask-based backend supports API calls.
